    "\n",
    "The learning objectives of the final projects are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a Python program that processes large geo datasets fast and efficiently.\n",
    "- Apply various data analysis and machine learning methods useful to mine geo data and using Python.\n",

    "The major tasks of this project are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a data analysis problem (a set of questions to explore) relevant to you, which includes analysis of gridded spatiotemporal data for a certain region and applies at least one machine learning method. I would like everyone find a project that excites them. The next section lists some criteria for the problem.\n",
    "2. Summarize your geospatial data analysis problem in written form and send it to me via e-mail by Saturday, November 20th, 2021.\n",
    "3. Develop a Python algorithm to map the data and approach the defined problem for at least one region.\n",
    "4. Perform the data analysis. Include code to visualize your results in a professional manner.\n",
    "5. Summarize your work in a paper and present your dataset and results in a lightening talk.\n"

    "## Criteria for choosing your data analysis problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose a geographical region. And therein at as many non-uniform boundaries you are interested in, these can be countries, US states, river basins.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select at least **two geophysical variables** you want to study. Both should exhibit spatial variablity and at least one of them temporal variability. Choose appropriate grided data sets on NASA archives or other data services and use python code to download at least one of the datasets. Example data sets are given below.\n",
    "    - At least one dataset should be \"large\", with the slice you are using having a minimum spatial size of ~ $latsize * lonsize > 100 * 100 $ and either covering a very long period (e.g. 100 years) or providing high temporal sampling (e.g. monthly for 20 years, daily for 5 years) \n",
    "    - The second dataset can also be any other non-uniformly sampled dataset you are interested in (e.g. groundwater well time series, seismic data, deformation data, ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The data analysis problem should include**:\n",
    "    - Characterization and visualization of spatial and/or temporal variations in the geophysical variables (e.g. via statistical metrics for each grid point and the region you chose). And comparison of the two geophysical variables (e.g., temporal or spatial changes, statistical metrics and output of the next item). **Define at least 3 questions you want to approach for these tasks.**\n",
    "    - **Apply at least one machine learning approach** exploring features in your dataset. **Define at least 1 questions you want to approach.**\n",
    "        - Build a regression model either for estimation of periodic and long-term changes in at least one datasets for the region of interest. Or to predict a third geophysical variable from two others.\n",
    "         - Apply one of the unsupervised machine learning methods (clustering and/or PCA) to explore features in your datasets.\n",
    "     - Discussion of the meaning of the extracted features and how they can support your research.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please consult me for ideas or discussion on how to utilize the methods. \n",

    "- If you work in a team, please indicate names of all collaborators in the doc-string of the script file. And make a statement on individual contributions at the end of the report. (Provide detail, who coded which part, and/or which parts you worked on together, and/or who wrote which part of the summary, etc.)!"
