    "This instructions are for setting up your GitHub connection with the ARC web-app at:\n",
    "https://ood.arc.vt.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/CLASS_geos6104Fall21/session_contexts/new.\n",
    "This needs to be done at the beginning of the class. \n",
    "Basically, we need to:\n",
    "- Configure GitHub\n",
    "- Invite me as collaborator to your repository (so your homework can be graded).\n",
    "- Configure Git on web-app to allow pushing to your personal repository (this is how you submit homework)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Sign up for a Github account\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Create a new, empty GitHub repository for your own coursework\n",
    "\n",
    "On GitHub, create a new, empty repository named:\n",
    "\n",
    "    geosf21_<pid>\n",
    "\n",
    "(pid should be your VT PID). For that, click on the 'New' button. Donâ€™t add a *readme* at this time. Make your repository private. \n",

    "## Step 3: Add me as a collaborator to your repository\n",
    "\n",
    "On GitHub, add me as a collaborator under 'Settings' > 'Manage access' of your repository. Please use my GitHub account name 'GeoPythonVT' or my e-mail address 'swerth@vt.edu'.\n",

    "## Step 4: Configure your ssh keys\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the terminal on the web-app\n",
    "2. Into the terminal, type:\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "   ... and copy the entire output.\n",
    "3. Now, you need to add this to your GitHub profile. In Github, click on the pulldown (top right) to view your profile and choose settings then SSH and GPG keys.\n",
    "4. Click on New SSH key, paste your RSA public key there and save.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Configure your local Git\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, type the following in your Terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git config --global user.email <you@example.com>  \n",
    "    git config --global user.name <GitHubUserName> \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 6: Clone the new repository to your local computer\n",
    "\n",
    "In the terminal window, change directories to where you want your coursework to live, for instance cd ~/Documents/. Then pull your repository onto your computer:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git clone git@github.com:<GitHubUserName>/geosf21_<pid>.git\n",
    "    \n",
    "Enter into your repository, which is currently empty:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cd geosf21_<pid>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 7: Push your first work to your repository \n",
    "\n",
    "In the terminal, enter the following commands to create new content for your repository and send it to GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    echo \"# Geos Python Fall 2021\" >> README.md\n",
    "    git add README.md\n",
