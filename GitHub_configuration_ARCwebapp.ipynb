    "This instructions are for setting up your GitHub connection with the ARC web-app at:\n",
    "https://ood.arc.vt.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/CLASS_geos6104Fall21/session_contexts/new.\n",
    "This needs to be done at the beginning of the class. \n",
    "Basically, we need to:\n",
    "- Configure GitHub\n",
    "- Invite me as collaborator to your repository (so your homework can be graded).\n",
    "- Configure Git on web-app to allow pushing to your personal repository (this is how you submit homework)\n",

    "## Step 1: Sign up for a Github account\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Configure your ssh keys\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you have a key, skip to step 5.\n",
    "2. Open a terminal on your computer, or in Jupyter Lab (click on + to the left and then on Terminal). \n",
    "3. In the terminal window, type: \n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    ssh-keygen\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "4. Ideally you will use a short passphrase different from your pid password, but can simply hit enter for most (or all prompts).\n",
    "5. Into the terminal, type:\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "   ... and copy the entire output.\n",
    "6. Now, you need to add this to your GitHub profile. In Github, click on the pulldown (top right) to view your profile and choose settings then SSH and GPG keys.\n",
    "7. Click on New SSH key, paste your RSA public key there and save.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Configure your local Git\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, type the following in your Terminal, or the Jupyter QTConsole:\n",

    "    git config --global user.email <you@example.com>  \n",

    "On GitHub, create a new, empty repository named:\n",
    "\n",
    "    geosf21_<pid>\n",
    "\n",
    "(pid should be your VT PID). For that, click on the 'New' button. Donâ€™t add a *readme* at this time. Make your repository private. \n",

    "## Step 6: Add me as a collaborator to your repository\n",
    "\n",
    "On GitHub, add me as a collaborator under 'Settings' > 'Manage access' of your repository. Please use my GitHub account name 'GeoPythonVT' or my e-mail address 'swerth@vt.edu'.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Step 7: Clone the new repository to your local computer\n",
    "\n",
    "In the terminal window, change directories to where you want your coursework to live, for instance cd ~/Documents/. Then pull your repository onto your computer:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git clone git@github.com:<GitHubUserName>/geosf21_<pid>.git\n",
    "    \n",
    "Enter into your repository, which is currently empty:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cd geosf21_<pid>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 8: Push your first work to your repository \n",
    "\n",
    "In the terminal, enter the following commands to create new content for your repository and send it to GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    echo \"# Geos Python Fall 2021\" >> README.md\n",
    "    git add README.md\n",
    "    git commit -m \"first commit\"\n",
    "    git branch -M main\n",
    "    git remote add origin git@github.com:<GitHubUserName>/geosf21_<pid>.git\n",
    "    git push -u origin main\n",
    "    \n",
    "If this set of commands is successful you are all setup and have made your first commit. If you refresh the Github page, you should see your README.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: You will need to repeat only some of these commands, when you submit your homework. These are listed on the main page of this repository (in the file readme.md). **\n",
